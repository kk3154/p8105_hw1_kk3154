## Problem 1

Creating a dataframe containing a random sample of size 10 from normal
distribution, logical vector for whether the elements of the sample are
&gt;0, character vector of length 10, and factor vector (3-level) with
length 10.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
set.seed(4321)

hw1_p1_df = tibble(
  rand_samp = rnorm(10, sd = 1),
  vec_logical = rand_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "hw", "1", "for", "BIST", "P8105", "fall", "2021", "semester"),
  vec_factor3 = factor(c("blue", "green", "blue", "red", "blue", "green", "green", "green", "red", "red"))
)

hw1_p1_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    rand_samp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor3
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>      
    ##  1    -0.427 FALSE       This     blue       
    ##  2    -0.224 FALSE       is       green      
    ##  3     0.718 TRUE        hw       blue       
    ##  4     0.841 TRUE        1        red        
    ##  5    -0.128 FALSE       for      blue       
    ##  6     1.61  TRUE        BIST     green      
    ##  7    -0.297 FALSE       P8105    green      
    ##  8     0.196 TRUE        fall     green      
    ##  9     1.24  TRUE        2021     red        
    ## 10    -0.719 FALSE       semester red

Attempting to take the mean of each variable.

What works?

What doesn’t?

Applying the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor
variables to convert to numeric data type.

NOT showing the results of this output.

What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens when you try
to take the mean?

``` r
#results = hide?
```

## Problem 2

The palmerpenguins data was installed in the console only.

Now loading the penguins dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins dataset contains …

The mean flipper length is NA mm.
